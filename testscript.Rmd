```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,warning = FALSE,message = FALSE,comment = FALSE,tidy = TRUE)

```{r,eval=F}
devtools::install_github("surbut/MSGene")
```

```{r}

```

# load our data

First, we load our sample data frame.

```{r}
data("testdf")
```

# set a training set

Now, we select a portion of the data for training
```{r}
train=df2[1:(nrow(df2)*0.80),]
```

# Parameter choice

Here we choose the ages we will consider and the states we will move through.

```{r}
ages=c(40:80)
nstates=c("Health", "Ht","HyperLip","Dm","Cad","death","Ht&HyperLip","HyperLip&Dm","Ht&Dm","Ht&HyperLip&Dm")
```

## Fit our model

Now we're ready to fit our model! Sit tight, this step takes between 60-90 seconds  ... but it's worht it.

```{r}

modelfit = fitfunc2(
  df_frame=data.table::data.table(train),
  ages = ages,
  nstates = nstates,
  mode = "binomial",
  covariates = "cad.prs+f.31.0.0+smoke+antihtn_now+statin_now")
```

Look at all that we've produced! 

```{r}

attributes(modelfit)

```

You can see in this array we have the number of events, `r dim(modelfit$events)`, the absolute rate per year per transition, the number at risk per year and per transition, and the list of models over years and states.



## Extract coefficients for health-->CAD transition

To compute our risk calculations, we need to extract the unsmoothed coefficients, we will feed through a smoother, and then use these coefficients to compute our product.

```{r}
a = coefplotsmooth2(
    ages = ages,
    start = nstates[1],
    stop = "Cad",
    modelfit = modelfit,
    window_width = 20,
    span = 0.75,
    degree = 2
  )
healthy_coefs = a$custom_smooth
```

```{r}
## create sample matrix to test

intercept=1
cad.prs=c(-2,-1,0,1,2)
sex=c(0,1)
smoke=c(0,1)
antihtn_now=c(0,1)
statin_now=c(0,1)
atrisk=expand.grid(intercept,cad.prs,sex,smoke,antihtn_now,statin_now)


mso = compute_prediction_product_matrix(
coefmat = healthy_coefs,
atrisk = atrisk,
agepredinterval = c(40:80)
)
```

# remaining lifetime risk matrix starting from each 40 for all 80 individuals in the profile

Now we compute the complement of the product of the annual surivivals.


```{r}
mso$PredictedIntervalrisk
```

Now we compute the complement of the product of the annual surivivals augmented by treatment.

# remaining lifetime risk matrix under treatment starting from 40

```{r}
mso$Hazard_treated
```
